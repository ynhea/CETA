A good way to make human-machine interaction more natural would be to develop a better metaphor.
A computer metaphor is a familiar object or activity that your computer imitates with its commands, display arrangements, and behavior.
The two main metaphors we have today are the desktop and the browser.
In the desktop metaphor, the display screen mimics a typical desk; information is kept inside folders, which can be opened, closed, and slipped into other folders.
With Web browsing, the metaphor is downtown window shopping; you gaze at various “storefronts,” see one you like, and (click) you enter.
Inside, there are more options to browse, you choose another, and again you enter.
Like a linguistic metaphor, the power of a good computer metaphor is that it makes a new system you don’t know behave like an old “system” with which you are familiar.
This lets you use the new system and get useful results out of it easily, since you don’t have to struggle learning new concepts and commands.
