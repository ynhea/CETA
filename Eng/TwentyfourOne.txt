Spectators are seen as a source of drive arousal.
This heightened state of arousal is presumed to facilitate the performance of well-learned or simple skills.
However, if a skill is not well-learned or complex, the increase in arousal will interfere with its performance.
The underlying notion is that an increase in drive arousal favors the emission of the performer’s dominant responses.
In the case of a skilled performer, her dominant responses are presumed to be largely “correct” ones.
Her performance stands to be improved with an audience present.
In a case where the performer is still struggling to master a skill, incorrect responses are present in abundance and are thereby presumed to be dominant responses.
As a consequence, onlookers can only worsen the performance of a beginner.
Hence, the performer’s level of skill and the complexity of the skill itself will determine whether an audience helps or hinders a performance.
