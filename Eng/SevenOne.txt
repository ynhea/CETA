According to research from the University of Arizona’s Bureau of Applied Research in Anthropology, the average household ends up wasting an average of 14 percent of its grocery spending by throwing away unused or spoiled food. 
Even worse, 15 percent of that waste includes products that were never opened and were still within their expiration date! 
(This statistic really makes me cringe — why not just set dollar bills on fire while we’re at it?) 
The study also found that a family of four ends up throwing away an average of ＄590 of perishable groceries per year, such as meat, produce, dairy, and grain products. 
You can save an average of ＄50 per month by avoiding overbuying perishable foods. 
Check your supplies before shopping and estimate the exact amount you’ll need to buy for the next week.
This is also a good time to throw away outdated leftovers, make sure perishable items are in view, and use up good leftovers for that day’s meals.
