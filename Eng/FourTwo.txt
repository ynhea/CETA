The quality of news is difficult to measure because there are no agreed-upon standards that satisfy everyone’s definition of high quality.
The term quality generally refers to any attribute, service, or performance that is highly valued within a group or a community.
Defining quality is thus context-dependent, field-specific, and subject to individual preferences and tastes.
It is important to note that compared to other cultural products such as music and paintings, journalistic content is unique because it has a strong civic and democratic component.
The idea of the press as the “fourth estate” stems from the expectation that high-quality journalism promotes democratic ideals by playing the role of a watchdog, providing a public forum, and serving as a reliable information provider.
Therefore, when discussing news quality, normative aspects cannot be overemphasized.
