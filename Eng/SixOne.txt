There are disturbing changes underway in today’s school systems. 
Funding is frequently tied to scores achieved on standardized tests, which primarily evaluate rote memory.
Teaching “to” tests like these inevitably focuses resources and curriculum on the lower-scoring students. 
The pressure to bring up test scores for these struggling students limits time for the kinds of individualized learning that challenges all students to reach their highest potential, and teachers have less opportunity to encourage creative thinking and incorporate hands-on activities.
When education is not enriched by exploration, discovery, problem solving, and creative thinking, students are not truly engaged in their own learning.
Because teachers are required to emphasize uninspiring workbooks and drills, more and more students are developing negative feelings about mathematics, science, history, grammar, and writing.
Opportunities to authentically learn and retain knowledge are being replaced by instruction that teaches “to the tests.”
