Human activity on the landscape can significantly contribute to soil erosion.
In a natural state, vegetation serves as natural protection against erosion because the network of roots helps hold the soil in place against various erosive forces, such as wind and water.
Scientists estimate that, in the United States, 30% of erosion is due to natural forces and 70% is due to human impact.
Oftentimes, when people use the land for farming, the protective covering of natural vegetation is destroyed, and the erosion process speeds up.
In fact, studies have shown that artificially created erosion played a big part in the downfall of many early civilizations.
Poor land management practices degraded the soil until it was no longer productive enough to support the population living in the area.
Early civilizations that recognized the disastrous effects of erosion used devices such as terracing the land to keep from plowing, planting, and irrigating on hillside slopes where water could wash the fertile soil away.
