In the summer of 1878, a thirty-year-old Dutch botanist named Hugo de Vries traveled to England to see
Darwin.
It was more of a spiritual journey than a scientific visit.
Darwin was vacationing at his sister’s estate in Dorking, but de Vries tracked him down and traveled out to meet him.
Thin, intense, and excitable, with a beard that rivaled Darwin’s, de Vries already looked like a younger version of his idol.
He also had Darwin’s persistence.
The meeting must have been exhausting, for it lasted only two hours, and Darwin had to excuse himself to take a break.
But de Vries left England transformed.
With no more than a brief conversation, Darwin had inserted a sluice into de Vries’s racing mind, completely redirecting it forever.
Back in Amsterdam, de Vries suddenly terminated his prior work on the movement of tendrils in plants and threw himself into solving the mystery of heredity.
