Many aspects of an ant’s appearance have likely evolved to meet a specific lifestyle requirement, although the extent to which this is true has not been fully explored for all aspects of its body structure.
Adaptations could be due to environment, available food, or predators.
Long legs and large eyes are commonly seen in ground-foraging ants that need to move quickly to avoid predators in open ground or be the first to acquire a food resource.
In contrast, ants that forage and nest in leaf litter have shorter legs and antennae, alongside small eyes.
This makes sense in the dark environment of leaf litter where moving through small spaces is easier with a compact body plan.
Based on the unique combination of body size measurements, scientists can predict where an ant nests and forages or even what kind of food it eats.
Predators have longer, flatter mandibles, while omnivores — those eating a diverse range of foods — have shorter, curved mandibles.
