One of the biggest misconceptions about creativity is that it takes a brilliant idea to solve a complex problem.
While this may be true in pure sciences, in most commercial contexts, or even in day-to-day living, it is never that one silver bullet that does the magic.
It is, in fact, a series of seemingly simple ideas that counts.
The key is to have enough ideas that solve specific parts of the overall problem, and then the thorny task looks very much tenable.
Since creativity comes from combining concepts in an unusual fashion, and since it is exceedingly difficult to trace the origins of ideas, you are better off generating as many ideas as possible with the hope that some of them would click.
That is what great scientists and artists do.
As the author Walter Isaacson notes, ‘The sparks come from ideas rubbing against each other rather than as bolts out of the blue.’
