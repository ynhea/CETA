The notion of a “circular economy” — in which materials circulate continuously, being used and reused time and time again — is an appealing vision.
However, it is crucial to highlight just how far we are from that goal at present.
Although most textiles are entirely recyclable, 73 percent of waste clothing was incinerated or went to landfills globally in 2015.
Just 12 percent was recycled into low-value textile applications such as mattress stuffing and less than 1 percent was recycled back into clothing.
Some would question how realistic the idea of “closing the loop” can be; the complexity of the fashion system means that there are multiple opportunities for materials to “leak” from the reuse cycle.
Furthermore, it must be noted that fiber recycling is not without its own environmental footprint.
Even the reuse of secondhand clothing has implications in terms of resource use and waste, particularly if items are transported over long distances, dry cleaned, and repackaged.
