When he was a Harvard student, world-famous cellist Yo-Yo Ma played often at concerts in and around
Boston.
He became very popular, and one day when one of his concerts was sold out, he gave a free concert for
those who were unable to obtain tickets - he sat in the theater lobby and played Bach cello suites.
Later in his career, when he was an international success, he still would often give more than required.
For example, many guest cello soloists play in the first half of a concert, then they are finished for the night.
However, Mr. Ma would sometimes play as part of the orchestra in the second half of the concert - doing this with the Philadelphia Orchestra was especially enjoyable for him.
He says, “It is an honor to play the back stands of the Philadelphia Orchestra.
It’s incredible the way those players listen, the knowledge they have.
I admire it so much.
And I feel the thrill of being part of something that’s greater than the sum of its parts — being accepted as part of the team.”
