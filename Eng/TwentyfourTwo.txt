Athletes do require more protein (and all nutrients) than sedentary people, but there is no evidence that they require a higher percentage of protein compared to other macronutrients in their diet to perform more optimally.
To put it another way, a diet with 10 percent protein is sufficient for most people, athlete and nonathlete alike.
If an average adult female eats 2,000 calories, 10 percent is 200 calories from protein.
If an average female athlete eats 3,000 calories, 10 percent is 300 calories from protein — that’s a 50 percent increase in protein achieved by simply eating more of the same foods.
So when you exercise, you don’t need to change the composition of the food (i.e., consuming foods with higher concentrations of protein or consuming protein powders).
You just need to eat more of the same foods.
The increased athletic activity will work up your hunger drive.
In response, you will consume more protein as well as nutrients of all types.
This works well since physical activity likely requires more of all nutrients, not just protein.
