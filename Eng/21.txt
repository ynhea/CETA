That perception is a construction is not true just of one's perception of sensory input, such as visual and auditory information.
It is true of your social perceptions as well â€• your perceptions of the people you meet, the food you eat, and even of the products you buy.
For example, in a study of wine, when wines were tasted blind, there was little or no correlation between the ratings of a wine's taste and its cost, but there was a significant correlation when the wines were labeled by price.
That wasn't because the subjects consciously believed that the higherpriced wines should be the better ones and thus revised whatever opinion they had accordingly.
Or rather, it wasn't true just at the conscious level.
We know because as the subjects were tasting the wine, the researchers were imaging their brain activity, and the imaging showed that drinking what they believed was an expensive glass of wine really did activate their centers of taste for pleasure more than drinking a glass of the same wine that had been labeled as cheaper.
That's related to the placebo effect.
Like pain, taste is not just the product of sensory signals; it depends also on psychological factors: you don't just taste the wine; you taste its price.
