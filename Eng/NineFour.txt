Lysippus was the most prominent, prolific and longest-lived of the great 4th-century BC sculptors. 
He was active, reportedly making 1,500 works, all of them in bronze.
Considered the most accomplished artist of his age, Lysippus suitably became Alexander the Great’s favourite — in fact, court-sculptor.
The world-conqueror allowed almost no one else to sculpt him.
Lysippus went on to make portrait busts of many of Alexander’s warring successors, such as Cassander and Seleucus Ⅰ.
A native of Sicyon in the Peloponnese, Lysippus ran a workshop of almost industrial size that was continued after his death by his sons.
Ancient writers such as Pliny relate that Lysippus invented an entirely new canon, or mathematically calculated ideal beauty, almost displacing that of Polyclitus.
