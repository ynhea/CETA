It is uncontroversially true that people in different societies have different customs and different ideas about right and wrong.
There is no world consensus on which actions are right and wrong, even though there is a considerable overlap between views on this.
If we consider how much moral views have changed both from place to place and from age to age it can be tempting to think that there are no absolute moral facts, but rather that morality is always relative to the society in which you have been brought up.
On such a view, since slavery was morally acceptable to most Ancient Greeks but is not to most Europeans today, slavery was right for the Ancient Greeks but would be wrong for todayâ€™s Europeans.
This view, known as moral relativism, makes morality simply a description of the values held by a particular society at a particular time.
This is a meta-ethical view about the nature of moral judgements.
Moral judgements can only be judged true or false relative to a particular society.
There are no absolute moral judgements: they are all elative.
