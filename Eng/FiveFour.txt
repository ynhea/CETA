When anticipating the effects of time, we should mentally forecast what they are likely to be; we should not practically stop them from happening, by demanding the immediate performance of promises which time alone can fulfill.
The man who makes his demand will find out that there is no worse or stricter usurer than Time; and that, if you compel Time to give money in advance, you will have to pay a rate of interest much higher than any usurer would require.
It is possible, for instance, to make a tree burst forth into leaf, blossom, or even bear fruit within a few days, by the application of unslaked lime and artificial heat; but after that the tree will wither away.
So a young man may abuse his strength — it may be only for a few weeks — by trying to do at nineteen what he could easily manage at thirty, and Time may give him the loan for which he asks; but the interest he will have to pay comes out of the strength of his later years; indeed, it is part of his very life itself.
