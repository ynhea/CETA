It used to be thought that Neanderthals were dim-witted, slouching cavemen completely covered with hair.
But this reputation is based on just one fossil, which modern scholarship has proved happens to be that of an old, diseased, and injured man.
He was approximately forty or forty-five years old when he died â€” very old for people at that time.
Healthy Neanderthals probably walked erect.
Objects found at Neanderthal sites show that Neanderthals could make complex tools.
The characteristics of their skulls suggest that they probably could speak, although perhaps not with the full range of sounds that modern humans make.
Sites also show that they did not necessarily live in caves, but, if they did, they likely altered the caves to make them more livable.
Sometimes they built shelters rather than settled in caves.
In 1996, scientists digging at a Neanderthal site in Slovenia announced they had found what appeared to be a musical instrument, a flute made from a bear bone.
