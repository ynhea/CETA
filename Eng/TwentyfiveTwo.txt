Architectural spaces become memorable through the architectural characteristics that define them.
Qualities of scale, appropriateness for people, aesthetics, and visual impact are among the many components that give a place its character and feel.
The purpose of a space can make it a place.
The Oval Office in the White House is a good example of a place with enormous historic significance.
The unique oval shape of this splendid room makes it memorable and gives it a special importance without being ostentatious.
Incidentally, George Washington had two rooms at Mount Vernon altered to include bowed ends so he could greet guests while standing in the middle as they circled around him.
Thomas Jefferson designed two oval rneeting rooms in the main floor of the Rotunda at the University of Virginia.
Oval rooms were seen as being democratic because no person could be placed at a more important position in the room than anyone else.
