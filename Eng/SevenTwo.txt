Throughout history, human imagination has been a double-edged sword.
On one hand, it pushes new discoveries, but for every newly established scientific fact, there are often multiple incorrect hypotheses, which must be corrected along the way or risk becoming myths.
Thomas Edison is credited with saying: “I have not failed. I’ve just found 10,000 ways that won’t work,” implying that error is part of invention.
Unfortunately, if errors or partial truths get circulated long enough, they can lead to a false echo chamber of repetition and suggest “truth” where none exists.
