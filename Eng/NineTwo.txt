Fado means “fate” in Portuguese, but is also the name of a form of music originating in Lisbon.
It is usually performed by one singer, accompanied by dual guitarras (mandolin-shaped 12-string guitars) and a viola (Spanish guitar).
Fado lyrics frequently focus on the hard realities of daily life, or the trials of love.
Fado is also linked with the notion of saudade, which is a longing for something impossible to attain.
Fadistas, as fado singers are known, often wear a black shawl of mourning, although songs can also be upbeat.
Since the 19th century, fado has been performed in bars and clubs in working-class districts of Lisbon.
It flourished during the Salazar years, before falling out of favour after the 1974 Revolution.
In recent times, the genre has been revived and a new generation of musicians and singers can be heard in casas de fado, around Lisbon.
