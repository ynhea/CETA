Often ideological principles crystallize in laws, rules, and institutions that threaten to block deals. 
Nationalism requires that all resources belong to the state and that no one else may own them. 
Islamic fundamentalism prohibits interest payments on loans.
Egyptian socialism demands that workers participate both in the management and the profits of an enterprise.
Each of these principles can be an obstacle to deal making in particular cases. 
Yet, with some creativity, it is possible to structure a deal in such a way that the ideological principle is respected but business goes forward.
For example, worker participation in management need not mean a seat on the companyâ€™s board of directors, but simply an advisory committee that meets regularly with an officer of the company.
And a petroleum development contract could be written in such a way that the ownership of oil is transferred not when the oil is in the ground but at the point that it leaves the flange of the well.
