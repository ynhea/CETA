When you think, you are using your imagination to create an image or picture in your mind of an event rather than the real thing.
If you are driving home from a football match, reviewing the game in your mind, you are merely imagining what the game was like.
The game is no longer real; it’s now only in your mind, in your memory.
It was real once, but not any longer.
Similarly, if you are thinking about how bad your marriage is, you are considering it in your mind.
It’s all in your imagination.
You are literally ‘making up’ your relationship.
The thoughts you are having about your relationship are just thoughts.
This is why the old saying, ‘Things aren’t as bad as they seem’ is almost always true.
The reason things ‘seem so bad’ is because your mind is able to recreate past events, and preview upcoming events, almost as though they were happening right in front of you, at that moment — even though they’re not.
To make matters worse, your mind can add additional drama to any event, thereby making that event seem even worse than it really is, or was, or will be.
