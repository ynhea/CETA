 Responding to life with joy and sorrow is part of being human.
At times when pain and suffering are inescapable, it is important to remember that this is part of the process by which we acquire knowledge.
This does not mean that one must be in discomfort to make art, but stress can be channeled into a creative force if it produces a sense of inquisitiveness and an incentive for change.
 Thinking through making pictures can allow us to place our distress in context.
The images we make can help us understand its source, catalog its scope, adapt ourselves to its presence, and devise ways to control it.
There are things in life, once called wisdom, which we have to discover for ourselves by making our own private journeys.
Stress can be directed to open up possibilities for intelligent and imaginative inquiries and solutions that otherwise might have been ignored, overlooked, or refuted.
