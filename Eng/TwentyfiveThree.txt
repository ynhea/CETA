Museum and gallery exhibitions are ‘hired’ by or co-produced with other galleries; it is not uncommon for shows to be ‘on the road' for two years or longer.
Normally they are curated by one or more people, whose role includes researching the exhibition concept, the selection (or commissioning) of work, planning how the work will be hung within the exhibition space and writing a
significant part of any accompanying book or catalogue.
The power of the curator, operating regionally, nationally or internationally, has been questioned.
Of course, curators take initiatives which contribute to the exposure of work.
But they may also regularly favour certain artists, or types of work, at the expense of others.
Furthermore, it has been suggested that curators often act more as ‘creators’, putting together themed exhibitions which, however relevant and interesting,
serve as much to advance themselves as to showcase the work of artists.
Indeed, all exhibitions and collections reflect the particular interests of their curators and archivists as well as the mission statement, priorities and terms of reference of particular organisations.
