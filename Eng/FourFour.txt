Political decisions and management decisions about how much of any given species can be harvested are often based on the amount of money there is to be made.
Profit leads to economic growth, which is the goal of many politicians and business leaders.
But the problem with seeking continuous economic growth is that our economy is not separate from our environment.
Everything in our economy comes from our environment.
We extract resources from the world around us, consume them as products we eat or use, and then dump the waste back into the Earth.
Our Earth is a finite ecosystem, which means there is only so much that we can take from the natural world to feed our economy, and only so much waste that the Earth can absorb, before natural processes stop functioning properly.
The constant effort to extract more and more resources is actually an ecological impossibility over the long term.
Our survival depends on learning to live within the limits of ecosystems.
