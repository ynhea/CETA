Most people don’t equate silence with appreciation.
People whose work is always good still need to hear it from you occasionally.
Let them know you’ve noticed they are meeting their goals.
Acknowledgement and appreciation create a supportive work environment and keep motivation alive.
Make your appreciation specific and positive by noting what was done well and why it matters.
This makes people feel good and it also ensures that the behaviour you identify is repeated.
So, don’t just say, “That was great!” Say, “That was great because ...”
Both teams and individuals need positive, specific information about their accomplishments.
Use your imagination: post graphs showing what the team has achieved; mark the achievement of major milestones or goals by bringing in sandwiches for lunch for everyone to share or putting up balloons; send thank you notes.
When you ignore success, people think it doesn’t matter and stop trying.
