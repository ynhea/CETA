One thing that managers have to keep in mind is that they should mend fences after any fight.
Opponents are not necessarily enemies.
An opponent disagrees with you on the issue, of course, but enemies are ones with whom you also have a negative relationship.
That makes it personal.
You can often work with opponents and strategize toward mutually successful outcomes, but enemies are far more difficult and consequently far more dangerous.
Try to keep opponents from becoming enemies, and work to turn enemies into mere opponents.
Find points of agreement, and find ways you can legitimately support those who were your opponents.
The subject of the fight will eventually recede, but you still need the relationships.
