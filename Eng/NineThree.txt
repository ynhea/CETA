The Mayan ball game was a very important part of Mayan culture.
The ball games were played either by 2 players or by 2 teams of players.
The object of the game was to put a ball through one of the stone rings while stopping the other team from putting the ball through the other stone ring.
The ball was a little larger than a basketball and was made of solid rubber.
For protection, players wore hard leather gloves, elbow and knee pads, masks, and belts that were made of wood or stone.
Although not all historians agree, some think the rules did not allow players to touch the ball with their hands or feet.
They used only their elbows, hips, and knees to hit the ball, and had to keep the ball from touching the ground.
Spectators from all classes liked to watch and bet on the games.
