Shifting demographics, household structures, lifestyle preferences, and consumer values suggest a different built environment and urban fabric 30 years ahead compared with 30 years ago.
More and more Americans, Australians, and Europeans are choosing to live in settings where they are less dependent on their cars because reducing air pollution and energy use matters to them.
A 2011 survey of more than two thousand adult Americans found seven times more people said the neighborhood where a house is located is a bigger consideration in deciding where to live than the size of the house.
Walking to restaurants, businesses, schools, and other amenities was the most appealing neighborhood feature for many respondents.
To many 20- and 30-somethings, walkable communities are equated with a downsized environmental footprint and energy efficiency, with the added benefit of burning calories during everyday activities.
If green buildings and solar panels dot the landscape and rooftops, all the better.
Notes one economist with the Urban Land Institute, “Energy efficiency is becoming the new granite countertops; it’s a necessary feature to sell the property.”
