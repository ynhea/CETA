There are no black-and-white issues in life.
No categorical answers. Everything is a subject for endless debate and compromise.
This is one of the core principles of our current society.
Because that core principle is wrong, the society ends up causing a lot of problems when it comes to sustainability.
There are some issues that are black and white.
There are indeed planetary and societal boundaries that must not be crossed.
For instance, we think our societies can be a little bit more or a little bit less sustainable.
But in the long run you cannot be a little bit sustainable — either you are sustainable or you are unsustainable.
It is like walking on thin ice — either it carries your weight, or it does not.
Either you make it to the shore, or you fall into the deep, dark, cold waters.
And if that should happen to us, there will not be any nearby planet coming to our rescue.
We are completely on our own.
