Movies featuring wonderful natural landscapes and charismatic wildlife often increase the desire of moviegoers to visit natural areas where they can see these landscapes and animals first-hand. 
But they can also raise awareness of environmental issues in new audiences. 
While many documentaries are created with this purpose in mind, such benefits can also extend to blockbuster movies meant for broader audiences. 
For example, Disneyâ€™s Happy Feet (2006) highlighted the threat of overfishing and plastic pollution to penguins; The Jungle Book (2016) exposed audiences to the endangered pangolins. 
Such exposure can even lead to environmentally conscious behavioural changes.
For example, moviegoers were willing to donate 50% more money to climate mitigation after watching the apocalyptic movie The Day After Tomorrow (2004). 
Perhaps, in part, due to the influence of environmentally-orientated movies, an increasing number of movie stars (and other celebrities) have started using their stardom as a platform from where they promote biodiversity conservation efforts in Africa.
