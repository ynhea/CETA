Ideally, when we make art or engage in any creative activity by ourselves, we recognize its value and make time and space for it in our lives.
The boom in coloring books and coloring pages in the past few years is one such example.
It takes away the challenging part of visual art-making and skills and provides us with a level of challenge that is relatively easy and manageable.
Our studies with cancer patients and caregivers showed that solitary activities like coloring helped in meditative and reflective ways by taking us to a space of distraction away from everyday concerns.
Such activities do not necessarily help us resolve our problems; rather, they provide a time to rest and a way to focus our attention elsewhere until such time as we can address them directly.
When we make art by ourselves, it can help us self-regulate; feel a sense of mastery, control, and agency over our lives; and engage in reflective, validating, contemplative, or meditative practices.
