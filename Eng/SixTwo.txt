For many years, it was indeed widely believed that the adult brain was essentially ‘set’, with all the neurons and major connections we’d need.
Sure, we learn new things and update our understanding of things all the time, meaning new connections are regularly being formed and turned over in networks governing learning and memory.
But in terms of overall physical structure and major connections, the stuff that makes us ‘what we are’, the adult brain was long thought to be ‘done’.
However, in recent years there’s been a steady stream of evidence revealing that the adult brain can change and adapt, even create new neurons, and experiences can still reshape the brain, even as we head into our twilight years.
Consider the taxi driver study, where constant driving and navigation of chaotic London streets leads to increased hippocampus size, revealing the adult brain structure is somewhat malleable.
