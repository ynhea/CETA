Consider people with disabilities.
Often they are judged using criteria of competence that are biased in favor of nondisabled people.
Compare, for example, an average blind person with an average sighted person.
Who will be more competent in walking from one place to another?
You might think that the sighted person will be more competent because the sighted person can see where he or she is going, but this is using an unfair criterion.
If you think about competence based on the fairer criterion of who can best walk with the eyes closed, then the blind person will definitely be more competent.
Such knowledge about people who are blind and, by extension, other socially marginalized people, can make us appreciate them and celebrate their unique abilities as they really are, rather than discriminate against, pity, or patronize them for some incompetence that does not exist except as a figment of our traditional, prejudiced imaginations.
