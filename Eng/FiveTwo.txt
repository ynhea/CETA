The modern corporation as a child of laissez-faire economics and of the market society is based on a creed whose greatest weakness is the inability to see the need for status and function of the individual in society.
In the philosophy of the market society there is no other social criterion than economic reward.
Henry Maine’s famous epigram that the course of modern history has been from status to contract neatly summarizes the belief of the nineteenth century, that social status and function should be exclusively the result of economic advancement.
This emphasis was the result of a rebellion against a concept of society which defined human position exclusively in terms of politically determined status, and which thus denied equality of opportunity.
But the rebellion went too far. In order to establish justice it denied meaning and fulfillment to those who cannot advance — that is, to the majority — instead of realizing that the good society must give both justice and status.
