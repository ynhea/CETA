Gladys West is an American mathematician.
She was born in rural Virginia in 1930.
She grew up on her family’s small farm and dreamed of getting a good education.
She worked hard and received a scholarship to Virginia State College (now Virginia State University), a historically black university.
In 1956 she was hired as a mathematician at the naval base in Dahlgren, Virginia.
She was the second black woman to be hired at the base and was one of only four black employees.
There, West made significant contributions to the applied mathematics that deals with the measurement of the Earth’s size, shape, and gravitational field.
West and her team created a model that allows the GPS system to make accurate calculations of any location on Earth.
West retired from the base in 1998 at the age of 68 but continued her education.
She later completed a PhD in Public Administration at Virginia Tech by distance-learning.
