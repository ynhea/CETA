Sometimes it is hard to know the right thing to do for the planet.
What sounds good may not necessarily be so.
Rooftop solar panels, for example, are one of the most expensive and least effective ways to help the environment.
Buying local food can actually increase water pollution and waste.
According to research from the Danish and UK governments, plastic grocery bags may actually be better than cotton bags for the climate and for water.
You may disagree with all or some of those claims, and you may be right.
It depends on your individual circumstances.
If you live in Phoenix, Arizona, for example, solar panels could be a smart choice.
Using your own cotton bags continuously and without exception for shopping for several years is probably better for the environment than the alternatives.
Each of these choices depends on personal circumstances and behavior.
The best solutions for the environment are personal.
