In recent years, there has been an increasing tendency of economists, scientists, and politicians to shift the focus from population growth to consumption as the more important underlying driver of biodiversity loss.
For many, the emphasis on consumption avoids politically charged topics, such as population control, which most people oppose on ethical or moral grounds, and because it is associated with divisive topics such as xenophobia, racism, and eugenics.
Others highlight that it is not the number of people per se, but how natural resources are consumed that is the main cause of environmental decline.
Indeed, rich people and rich countries have a disproportionate impact on the natural environment because they consume a disproportionately large share of the world’s natural resources.
To use one example, the USA accommodates only 5% of the world’s human population but uses 25% of the world’s harvested natural resources each year.
In fact, decorative Christmas lights in the USA alone use more energy than the annual energy usage of the entirety of Ethiopia or Tanzania.
And yet, the average USA citizen uses less than half of the energy that an average citizen of Qatar uses, Qatar being a small but wealthy Middle Eastern country.
