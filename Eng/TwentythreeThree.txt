However skilled you may be at bowling, there will always be minute changes in the angle at which you release the ball that will be magnified as the ball travels the length of the lane.
As it strikes, the first skittle falls back either slightly to the right or the left, and the ball is deflected slightly in the other direction. 
From then on, within a fraction of a second, skittles start falling in different directions, sometimes hitting others as they fall.
The differences in the final arrangement of skittles each time are difficult to predict from the slight variation of angle as the ball leaves the bowlerâ€™s hand.
Even those who can achieve strike after strike actually achieve a different strike every time, for the skittles will never fall in exactly the same way twice.
